# charts

:warning: This repository is deprecated and will not be updated. Please migrate to https://github.com/community-tooling/charts.

Every chart available in this repository is available on community-tooling/charts in the latest version from this repository, too.

## To migrate

1. Update to the **second latest** version available in morremeyer/charts. There has been a major version bump to alert everyone to the breaking change of the repository move.
1. For example, for the **generic** chart, upgrade to version `7.2.1`, **not** to `8.0.0`
1. If you already upgraded to the major version for the repository move, you **can safely and should** downgrade to the version before that
1. Change repository references from morremeyer/charts to community-tooling/charts. New versions will be published there.

## Why?

This repository is under my ([morremeyer](https://github.com/morremeyer)) control. Although I can add collaborators, if I ever decide that I don't want to maintain it anymore, or I am unavailable for longer periods of time, it would be hard to impossible to administer the repo without me.

For that reason, I have decided to move it to a dedicated organization, https://github.com/community-tooling. This organization also hosts some OCI images that are commonly used in my (and other people's) infrastructure.

The organization enables me to give others full control, too.

As with almost every breaking change, the earlier you make it, the easier it will be to migrate. Therefore, we're doing this now instead of when the need is really there.

<summary>Old README</summary>
