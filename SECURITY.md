# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open an issue if you find a vulnerability. Send an email to `charts@mor.me` and
a maintainer will get in touch with you as soon as possible. This might take up to 72 hours.

We will keep you up to date with all developments via email.

Once we checked your report and confirmed the vulnerability, we'll patch it as soon as possible and issue a security advisory afterwards.
