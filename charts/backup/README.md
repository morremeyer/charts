## Upgrades

For upgrade instructions for breaking changes, see [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md).

## Usage

If you want to regularly back up the contents of a PVC, use this minimal example for your values.yaml

```yaml
pvc: name-of-pvc
repo: s3:https://minio.example.com/name-of-pvc
backupJob:
  affinityLabels:
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: morre-paperless
    app.kubernetes.io/name: paperless
```

This will back up every day at 03:17. At 15:17, a cleanup will run and keep:

* 8 daily snapshots
* 5 weekly snapshots
* 13 monthly snapshots
* 2 yearly snapshots

For more advanced use cases, check the configuration section below or the values.yaml file.

## Configuration

The following table lists the configurable parameters of the chart and the default values.

## Values

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| backupJob.additionalVolumes | list | `[]` | Additional volumes to add to the pod, e.g. to backup hostPaths. |
| backupJob.affinity | object | `{}` | to specify a full `spec.affinity` map for a pod. In most cases, `backupJob.affinityLabels` will be sufficient. |
| backupJob.affinityLabels | object | `{}` | labels of a pod that a strict affinity for scheduling will be set to. Needed for `ReadWriteOnce` PVCs. |
| backupJob.backup.additionalVolumeMounts | list | `[]` | Additional volumes to mount to the restic container, e.g. to backup hostPaths. |
| backupJob.backup.args | list | `[]` | arguments for the backup. **Automatically generated, only set when necessary** |
| backupJob.backup.command | string | `nil` | command for the backup. Defaults to '/usr/bin/restic' by the upstream container. |

| cleanupJob.affinity | object | `{}` |  |
| cleanupJob.args | list | `[]` | arguments for the cleanup. **Automatically generated, only set when necessary** |
| cleanupJob.command | string | `nil` | command for the cleanup. Defaults to '/usr/bin/restic' by the upstream container. |
